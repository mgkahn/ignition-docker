# Building in Perspective Simulator Instructions - Version 1.0.1

This resource contains a CSV file that's intended to be used with Ignition's programmable device simulator as part of the "Building in Perspective" Inductive University course. Simply download this package, open the instructions.CSV file, and follow the instructions in the "Gateway Configurations" lesson.

## Installation

### Common Instructions

**Tags (.json/.xml/.csv)**  
Ignition can export and import Tag configurations to and from the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file format. You can import XML (Extensible Markup Language) or CSV (Comma Separated Value) file formats as well, but Ignition will convert them to JSON format. Tag exports are imported in the Designer. Once the Designer is opened you can click on the import button in the Tag Browser panel.
